# HunterPie
HunterPie is a software that reads the game memory (only reads, it doesn't write anything to it) to find the necessary data for discord rich presence and to update the overlay with useful stuff.
HunterPie is a C# version of [HunterPy](https://github.com/Haato3o/HunterPy/), it has a better UI and overlay compared to the Python version and is also faster and lighter.

# Installation
You can download the latest version [here](https://github.com/Haato3o/HunterPie/releases/latest), extract the file and then run HunterPie.exe, it will auto-update whenever there's a newer version.

# How to use
## Rich presence
The discord integration is enabled by default, you just need to open your game and let HunterPie running in the background, however it can be disabled anytime in HunterPie settings.

## Overlay
**THE OVERLAY ONLY WORKS WHEN THE GAME IS IN BORDERLESS FULLSCREEN OR WINDOWED!**

HunterPie has an overlay that can be toggled on/off. You can also disable any of the widgets in the overlay separately in case you don't like one of them as well as change the widgets position.

### Monster health
Shows monsters name, current health, total health and has a health bar.

### Mantles Cooldown
Shows the mantles cooldown and timer when wearing one, this widget only appears when the cooldown and timer are actually running. You can also change the widget color in HunterPie settings, it uses HEX color with alpha (#RRGGBBAA)

### Harvest Box
Shows fertilizer names and amount left and the total items in harvest box. It only appears in Astera and gathering hub.

### More widgets and info to be added soon...
